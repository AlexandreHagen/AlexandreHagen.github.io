## About Gary

Gary is a sculptor whose artistic work is organic, such as bronze skins with
telluric pulses properties. Within the curves of her shapes, the force snuggles
in an everlasting cycle for the birth of a world.

Her philosophy centers on becoming one with our surroundings - erasing, forgetting
in order to be pervious, accepting to lose oneself so as to receive better.

## Collections

### Spheres
Bronze sphere sculptures with organic surface textures:
- **Talos** - 20cm diameter bronze sphere
- **Arborescence** - 20cm diameter with tree-like organic patterns
- **Scherie** - 30cm diameter bronze sphere
- **Brocelian** - 50cm diameter, the largest sphere in the collection
- **Hermès** - 30cm diameter bronze sphere with red patina

### Spheres In Situ
Bronze sphere sculptures integrated into natural landscapes and gardens.
The spheres find their place among olive trees, stone walls, poolsides,
and lush vegetation, creating a dialogue between art and nature. Their
patina evolves with the seasons, making each installation a living,
ever-changing presence.

### Sky Catchers
Sound sculptures created in collaboration with composer Michel Redolfi.
Whimsical jungle vines forged in a resonant alloy that vibrate throughout
their length, spatialising sound like acoustic misting.
